## ‚ö° Overview

Most Discord bots available to the end-users nowadays are either built to be a jack-of-all-trades or are too specific to a particular niche. IgKnite is a Discord bot that aims to be the middle ground between these two extremes. It is a bot that is designed to be a playground for creative commands, while also providing a polished experience for moderation and music commands.

IgKnite is built on top of the [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) API wrapper for Discord, and is easily self-hostable to the point where you can easily run it on your local computer. The bot's codebase is asynchronous and easily extendable since it's made fully open-source.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Features

- Battle-tested moderation commands for stable community moderation.
- Low-level & polished music system (YouTube + Spotify) for everyday use.
- Both developer and user friendly at once.
- Fully open-sourced with love (including assets!).
- No buzz, all buff! <br>

## üîñ Usage

IgKnite has its own [documentation webpage](https://igknitedev.github.io/docs) where you can learn about everything, starting from the commands to even self-hosting the bot on your local computer. <br>
