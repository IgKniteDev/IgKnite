<p>IgKnite is a slash-first, Discord bot built on the goal for making a truly unified application experience for Discord possible.

<br>

## Features

- Written with <3 in pure Python!
- Asynchronous code for increased performance.
- Command-rich use cases.

<br>

## Setup

If you want to add IgKnite to your own server, [consider clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1016637486702792735&permissions=1505385246135&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and you'll automatically be redirected to Discord's webpage. You can also [find a server]() which has IgKnite in it, then you can click on IgKnite's profile picture to toggle its profile view and add it from there :D
