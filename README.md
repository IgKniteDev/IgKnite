## Overview

Introducing IgKnite, a slashes-first Discord bot that has been made on the goal of creating a truly unified experience for Discord. Being a Discord bot, IgKnite's primary purpose is to serve its users with a delightful command handler that is both easier to use and responsive. IgKnite's still an infant, but it's growing gradually!

<br>

## Features

- Source code written in pure Python.
- Asynchronous nature for faster response times.
- Evergrowing collection of commands (with a few alien ones!).
- Prioritized interactions over traditional text commands.

<br>

## Setup

If you want to add IgKnite to your own server, [consider clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1016637486702792735&permissions=1505385246135&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and you'll automatically be redirected to Discord's webpage. You can also [find a server]() which has IgKnite in it, then you can click on IgKnite's profile picture to toggle its profile view and add it from there :D

<br>

## How to use?

Once added to your Discord server, [click here](https://igknitedev.github.io/docs) and you will be greeted with a curated documentation that has all the things you need to know about IgKnite written inside. This includes everything from using commands to even self-hosting IgKnite on your local computer!
