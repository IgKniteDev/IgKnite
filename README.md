## Motive

Discord has always been the go-to platform for communities to make a solid base for hanging out and building servers to communicate and grow upon. This can somehow correlate to developers, as Discord has long been appreciating the programming of 'bots' since it started. To put it simply, this social platform has its own community of developers who are pretty enthusiastic about making interactive applications that are useful in many different scenarios. However, as developers continue to make their bots more capable than ever, there is always this very lack of 'original' applications that truly rely and are hosted on open-source technologies. 

<br><br>

## Goals

The goal, in this case, is simply to create a bot that uses Discord's bleeding-edge API in order to make **interactive commands really interactive**. Speaking of which, interactions like buttons, context menus are a must-have when it comes to making the usage path easier for the end-user. Combined with the inspiration and ideas from renowned bots like [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz) and [Fredboat](https://fredboat.com), we've decided to **raise IgKnite by developing a unified experience when it comes to music and moderation.** 

<br><br>

## Technologies

The original idea for IgKnite has long been in the brainstorming sessions of a few developers. In fact, a bot wrapped with the **discord.py** library was also put together to be hosted for the public. Following that very idea, this project now depends on:

- [x] [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) to wrap around Discord's API (for now).
- [x] [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.
- [ ] [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/) for making music possible.

<br>

Pro Tip | IgKnite is still in its very infant stages, so it's quite normal for it to expand this small chain of dependencies over time.
