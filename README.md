## ⚔️ Mission

Most Discord bots these days are closed-source and incomplete. This is due to every developer having specific goals on what to make with Discord's API. Thus, there has recently not been a fully open-sourced approach to creating Discord bots that are both easy to access and stable at the frontend.

Our mission with IgKnite is to fulfill that gap. Meaning that, we're creating a Discord bot that is aimed at both the moderators of Discord servers and the casual, everyday users. We aim to make the moderation experience easier with simple yet stable, fail-safe commands while also entertaining users with music and a handful of easily accessible commands. All of this while also keeping this project **open-source and free forever!**<br>

## ⚡ Features

- Moderation commands, made creative and easy.
- Low-level & polished music system (support for both YouTube & Spotify).
- Asynchronous code on top of the [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) API wrapper.
- A playground all by itself for creative commands.
- Fully open-source including assets.
- No buzz, all buff! <br>

## 📝 Usage

IgKnite has its own [documentation webpage](https://igknitedev.github.io/docs) where you can learn about everything, starting from the commands to even self-hosting the bot on your local computer. <br>
