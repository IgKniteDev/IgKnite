## Motive

Discord has always been the go-to platform for communities to make a solid base for hanging out and building servers to communicate and grow upon. This can somehow correlate to developers, as Discord has long been appreciating the programming of 'bots' since it started. To put it simply, this social platform has its own community of developers who are pretty enthusiastic about making interactive applications that are useful in many different scenarios. However, as developers continue to make their bots more capable than ever, there is always this very lack of applications that truly rely and are hosted on open-source technologies. 

The goal, in this case, is simply to create a Discord bot that uses Discord's bleeding-edge API to interact with the users of it and provide them with a delightful experience.

## Tech Stack

The original idea for IgKnite has long been in the brainstorming sessions of a few developers. In fact, a bot wrapped with the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library was also put together to be hosted for the public. Following that very idea, IgKnite is being wrapped with the [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) library **(for now, until discord.py catches up)** and will have its future development done with the help of other Python libraries as well. The noting will be done gradually with the development of the first release.
